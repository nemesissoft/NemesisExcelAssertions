In Java given:
public sealed interface NumberAssertion {
    void apply(AbstractDoubleAssert<? extends AbstractDoubleAssert<?>> assertion);
}
implement records implementing this interface: CloseToPercentNumberAssertion, CloseToOffsetNumberAssertion, EqualToNumberAssertion, GreaterThanNumberAssertion, GreaterThanOrEqualToNumberAssertion, LessThanNumberAssertion, LessThanOrEqualToNumberAssertion, WithinRangeNumberAssertion, OutsideRangeNumberAssertion that will abstract away assertion logic and will add appropriate assert in apply method. Override toString to provide meaningful but concise info like "==5.5" or ">3.0",
For CloseToOffsetNumberAssertion and CloseToPercentNumberAssertion store inside classes strongly typed domain object (Percentage and Offset from assertj)

Records WithinRangeNumberAssertion, OutsideRangeNumberAssertion should store data about range: from, to and additional info if start and end should be inclusive or not( by default both should be inclusive) - this properties should be called exclusiveFrom/exclusiveTo and use false as default. Add validation using compact constructor to check if "to" is greather than "from"

For simplicity classes should not be public but package private and stored in same file as interface

toString should use grammar/format so that is can end sentence "number to be ..." i.e. but it should be short and mathematical for OutsideRangeNumberAssertion that should be "number to be ∉ [1..6)" which would rad "beyond range 1(inclusive) and 6(exclusive)"


LATER

Add polymorphic serializer / deserializer for NumberAssertion using Jackson using following format:
{
  "operation": string in format described below for ranges and CloseTo* classes or number literal representing "expected" or "threshold",
}
operation should be a discriminator for classes as follows:
- EqualToNumberAssertion: "eq" should be used for serialization but "==" and "=" should also be supported
- GreaterThanNumberAssertion: "gt" should be used for serialization but ">" should also be supported
- GreaterThanOrEqualToNumberAssertion: "gte" should be used for serialization but ">=" should also be supported
- LessThanNumberAssertion: "lt" should be used for serialization but "<" should also be supported
- LessThanOrEqualToNumberAssertion: "lte" should be used for serialization but "<=" should also be supported
- CloseToOffsetNumberAssertion: "close" should be used for serialization but "~" and "≈" should also be supported. String used to serialize payload should be in form: "expected+-offset.value". Optionally format where +- is swapped to "±" should also be supported.
- CloseToPercentNumberAssertion: "closePercent" should be used for serialization but "close%", "≈%" and "~%" should also be supported. String used to serialize payload should be in form: "expected+-percentage.value%". Optionally format where +- is swapped to "±" should also be supported.

- WithinRangeNumberAssertion: "in" should be used for serialization but "∈" and "within" should also be supported. String used to serialize payload should be in form: "[from..to]". Square brackets should be used for inclusive range boundary, parentheses should be used for exclusive boundary.

- OutsideRangeNumberAssertion: "notIn" should be used for serialization but "∉", "out" and "beyond" should also be supported. String used to serialize payload should be in form: "[from..to]". Square brackets should be used for inclusive range boundary, parentheses should be used for exclusive boundary.


Serializer and deserializer should be nested classes inside NumberAssertion and be registered using annotations:
@com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.annotation.JsonSerialize(using = NumberAssertion.NumberAssertionSerializer.class)
@com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.annotation.JsonDeserialize(using = NumberAssertion.NumberAssertionDeserializer.class)


All other fields and formats should not be supported. Essentially serialization should only support exactly one field inside object JSON literal
For serialzier and deserializer use Enum-based discriminator model

change ctxt.mappingException with JsonMappingException.from

NumberAssertionType.fromKey should return null and not throw if key is not found
Add tests for these ser/deser. Add positive and negative flows. Use assertj and @MethodSource

Do not use "Helper classes for test cases". Opt for text blocks for JSONs

For invalidDeserializationCases use Named.of
